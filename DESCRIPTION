Description: Alternate font rendering is useful when rendering to novel
   graphics outputs where modern font rendering is not available or 
   not appropriate.  Bitmap and vector fonts allow for bespoke rendering using
   pixel coordinates and line drawing.  A selection of fonts is included and
   all can be rendered to a matrix of pixel locations or returned as
   pixel coordinates and collections of stroke endpoints.
